                <p>Pass through an alley in the new land of Xijiang Community in Yuzhou District to the former site of the Yulin Central County Committee of the Communist Party of China. The photos and materials hanging on the wall shine with the light of history, making people feel like walking through the tunnel of time and returning to the red years. </p>
                At a critical moment, the Congress of the <p> Five Genera of Yulin was held in the Chen Huangquan Ancestral Hall, where the revolutionary ancestors strategized and pushed the Yulin Anti-Japanese Salvation Movement to a climax. </p>
                Today, the <p> smoke of history has dissipated, and the old site has been transformed into a "red block", and the revolutionary spirit engraved on these historical sites still radiates and is passed down from generation to generation. </p>
                <h3>Eighty-two years ago, red seeds were sprinkled here</h3>
                <p>The former site of the Yulin Central County Committee of the Communist Party of China is a Qing Dynasty building with a green brick structure, 11.5 meters wide, 20.7 meters long and 8.5 meters high. The house is orderly displayed with tables and chairs, oil lamps, party flags and other mottled old things, which still vaguely retain the appearance of the past. </p>
                <p>The former site is located in the Chen Huangquan Ancestral Hall, now belonging to the Xijiang Community of Yucheng Street, Yuzhou District, the ancestral hall was built in the middle of the Qing Dynasty and has a history of nearly 200 years. In February 1939, party representatives from the five counties of Yulin gathered here for a meeting, and the meeting finally deliberated and decided that the central county party committee would be established in Yulin County, and the leader of the central county party committee would be the leader of the special branch of Yulin County. Recently, at the former site of the Yulin Central County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, Jiang Changying, secretary of the community party committee in the west of Yucheng Street, Yuzhou District, told reporters that for a long time in the past, this place was far from the world's prosperity, and few people knew the story of this old tile house. In the word of mouth of the old people, people know that under their feet is the hot land where the revolutionary pioneers once fought</p>
                <p>In the lecture hall, several rows of benches and tables were placed in the center, and visitors stopped to sit and rest, and you talked about the history of the old county party committee every word. In a flash, it seems that in February 1939, I saw the eight CPC members full of ideals and beliefs holding a meeting of representatives of the five Yulin genera (Yulin, Bobai, Luchuan, Beiliu, and Xingye) here to plan for the anti-Japanese rescue work. </p>
                <p>This meeting is significant and far-reaching. The meeting decided to establish the Yulin Central County CPC Committee, subordinate to the leadership of the CPC Guangxi Provincial Work Committee, and elected Chen Tiesheng, Xiong Jingsheng and Luo Chongni to form the Yulin Central County CPC Committee, with Chen Tiesheng as secretary. At this time, the main work of the county party committee was to carry out propaganda on resisting Japan and saving the country, mobilizing and arming the people, reducing rent and interest rates, eliminating traitors and enemy spies, etc., and in the eight months of its existence, it completed several major tasks and promoted the good development of the anti-Japanese rescue work of the five genera of Yulin. </p>

                <p>It is understood that in addition to establishing anti-Japanese guerrilla armed forces and making preparations for establishing anti-Japanese guerrilla bases and launching anti-Japanese guerrilla wars, the Yulin Central County CPC Committee also opened various training courses, trained a large number of anti-Japanese backbones, and actively recruited party members; by April 1939, there were 217 party members in five counties, strengthening the party's leadership over the anti-Japanese rescue movement of the five subordinates of Yulin, and pushing the anti-Japanese rescue movement in this area to a climax. </p>
                <p>In early July 1939, in accordance with the spirit of the "Economic Circular on Organization Issues" issued by the Southern Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Guilin Office of the Eighth Route Army announced the abolition of the Guangxi Provincial Work Committee and the establishment of three special branches in Guilin, Wuzhou and Nanning. In October of the same year, after the establishment of the three special branches, the Yulin Central County Committee of the Communist Party of China was abolished. </p>

                <p>After completing the tasks given by the times, the Yulin Central County Committee of the Communist Party of China restored the color of the Chen Huangquan Ancestral Hall in the past, quietly waiting for the return of time. In 1980, the former site of the county party committee was listed as a county-level cultural relic protection unit, in 1995 it was listed as a county-level revolutionary traditional education base and patriotism education base, and later it was designated as a revolutionary tradition and patriotism education base in Yuzhou District. </p>

At present, the place has formed the theme pavilion of the glorious road of the growth of the Guangxi party organization, the former site of the Yulin Central County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, the red movie hall, and the red original heart lecture hall "one hall, one site, one hall and one lecture hall", and radiated to build a "red block" in Xindi, so that the red memory will shine forever.</p>

                <p>The whole repair process was very careful and meticulous. When repairing the roof, cocking the goose's head, demolishing the chimney, painting the walls, etc., it was not blindly demolished and built, and the old site was repaired as much as possible to maintain the original appearance of the old site. Today, the old place has a new look. Visitors walked along the asphalt road, and they were greeted with the atmosphere of revolution and the style of party building. In the solemn theme pavilion of the road to glory, there are precious information pictures and shocking scenes, showing the heroic deeds of the revolutionary martyrs in Yulin and the development process of party organizations in Guangxi and Yulin. People wandered in the hall of the former site of the county party committee, browsing carefully, quietly feeling the "red heartbeat" of Yulin people.</p>

                "The Yulin <p>Central County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China is a pure red holy place, which once influenced the Yulin Revolution of that era, sowing red seeds and leaving valuable spiritual wealth to Yulin." Jiang Changying said that the purpose of maintaining and repairing the former site of the Yulin Central County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China is to build a platform for promoting red culture and pass on red genes from generation to generation. On weekdays, it is open to the public free of charge, and the nearby Xizheng Primary School, Guding Primary School, Dongming Primary School, etc., will also regularly organize students to visit and study. </p>

During the visit, the staff invited everyone to sit down in the hall of the Red Theater and played a stage play called "Tinder", restoring the red story of the anti-Japanese rescue movement carried out by the five Yulin masses during the revolutionary period, which caused cheers from the audience. In the Red Theater at the former site of the county party committee, community workers and the masses wrote and performed their own cultural and artistic programs, telling red stories, interpreting revolutionary history, spreading the red spirit, strengthening education in patriotism and party spirit, enriching the cultural life of community party members and residents, and also remembering revolutionary heroes, feeling the historical heaviness of this land, and cheering for the hard-won good life.</p>

It has become an important place for Party members and cadres to understand the Party's history and strengthen Party spirit, an important position for the masses to cultivate patriotic feelings and cultivate national spirit, and an important classroom for young people to learn revolutionary traditions and cultivate moral sentiments. </p>
                <p>"Move the classroom of Party history study to the 'red block', let the broad masses and cadres immerse themselves in it, follow the red footsteps of their predecessors, feel the passionate revolutionary spirit, and draw inspiration and forging ahead from it." The narrator of the former site of the Yulin Central County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China told reporters that in this dense residential room and leisurely alley, nearby schools, units and other organizations came from time to time to carry out patriotic education. According to incomplete statistics, since its opening, more than 290 units, more than 8,000 party members and nearly 20,000 people have visited the museum. </p>
