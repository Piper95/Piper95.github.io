                            Don't forget yesterday's suffering and glory, be worthy of today's mission, and live up to tomorrow's great dreams
                        </p>
                        <p >
                            From November 8 to 11, the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was successfully held in Beijing, comprehensively summing up the major achievements and historical experience of the Party over the past century, calling on the whole Party and the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country to learn from history, open up the future, immerse themselves in hard work, forge ahead courageously, and make unremitting efforts to achieve the second centenary goal and realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The successful convening of the plenary session aroused strong repercussions among the vast number of party members and cadres in Yulin City.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "On the new journey, I will lead the majority of agricultural technology promoters to consciously and actively integrate into the overall situation of the rural revitalization strategy, regard the 'field' as the main position and the main battlefield, strive to cultivate more technical personnel and local talents, and write the latest and most beautiful chapter of agricultural development in the vast land of China." Peng Yansen, a national outstanding Communist Party member, a national top ten pacesetter in agricultural technology promotion, and director of the Rong County Animal Disease Prevention and Control Center, said.
                        </p>
                        <p>"I will focus on the sober and arduous struggle of those who have traveled a hundred miles, focus on improving the organizational strength of rural grassroots party organizations, be a good 'leader' of rural revitalization, expand and strengthen the characteristic industry of 'Hakka Guiyuan' with new technologies, new processes and new standards, and promote the formation of a model of prosperity led by branches, demonstrated by party members, and driven by capable people, so that the lives of villagers can blossom and flourish." The "most beautiful retired soldier" in the country, said Li Chunyan, secretary of the general party branch and director of the village committee of Emei Village, Fengshan Town, Bobai County.</p>
                        <p>The party members and cadres of the whole city immediately studied and understood the spirit of the plenary session,Expressing the need to regard the study, publicity, and implementation of the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee as a major political task at present and for some time to come,Further unify thinking, strengthen confidence, and do our own things in a down-to-earth manner,It has made greater contributions to the construction of the "four strong, two districts and one beauty" two-bay pilot pilot zone in our city, and to write a new chapter in the magnificent Yulin of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era in Guangxi.</p>

                        <p>"Making resolutions on historical issues at major historical junctures and seeking truth from facts to sum up the party's historical achievements and historical experience is our party's fine tradition and valuable experience in governing the party and the country." Huang Yuan, an outstanding member of the Communist Party of China, a deputy to the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and deputy head of the Criminal Investigation Detachment of the Yulin City Public Security Bureau, said that the "Resolution of the CPC Central Committee on the Major Achievements and Historical Experience of the Party's Centennial Struggle" deliberated and adopted by the plenary session is a political declaration for Chinese communists in the new era to keep in mind their original mission and adhere to and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics. "I will continue to perform well the sacred duty of deputies to the 19th CPC National Congress, persist in taking the small matters of the people as my own major affairs, start from the things that the people are concerned about, start from the things that satisfy the people, and let the people feel that fairness and justice are around them in every case and every small matter, so as to contribute to the construction of a higher level of safe China and rule of law China."</p>
                        <p>"The Resolution adopted by the plenary session made me feel that the construction industry is similar to the construction of great projects. To lead the development of the construction industry in the right direction, we must adhere to the leadership of the party, give full play to the leading role of the party committee of the construction industry, let the party flag fly high on the construction site, build ingenuity with the party's heart, and create more projects that can stand the test of history and the people. Tang Mengchun, secretary of the party committee of the construction industry in Fumian District, Yulin City, said.</p>
                        <p>The achievement of a century of glory is inseparable from the relay and responsibility of countless cadres. Huang Ting, member of the Standing Committee of the Fumian District CPC Committee and director of the Organization Department, said that on the way to march towards the second centennial goal, they will deeply implement the "baton project" for young cadres, promote more young cadres to go to the frontline to fight through storms, strengthen their bones, and build their souls, and forge a young force with no fear of change, the courage to break the situation, and a good start of the new situation.</p>
                        <p>The journey is long, and there is only struggle. My generation is self-reliant and lives up to the times!</p>
