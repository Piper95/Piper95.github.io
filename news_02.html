                            On August 28, 2020, Yulin Fumian Airport was officially opened to traffic, becoming the first of the three major events in Yulin City: "building a high-speed railway, repairing an airport and building a wharf". On December 11 of that year, the passenger throughput of Yulin Fumian Airport exceeded 100,000 person-times! Yulin Fumian Airport was completed and opened, filling the gap of Yulin's air transportation, and becoming a new window to display Yulin's image, a new driving force for Yulin's development, and a new platform for opening up to the outside world.

With this "spirit", the people of Yulin fulfilled their aviation dream in 2020, and in the near future, the dream of high-speed rail and navigation will definitely be realized!

                        <p>Walking into Guangxi Advanced Equipment Manufacturing City (Yulin), I saw a busy scene: on the one hand, the completed projects are busy seizing the time to produce products, on the other hand, the newly signed projects are "gearing up" and preparing to start construction, and the enterprises in the park are striving to achieve a good start and a good step in the high-quality development of the "14th Five-Year Plan" with the momentum of "speeding up at the beginning and competing at the beginning".</p>
                        <p>Tongfang Computer Yulin Base is Tsinghua Tongfang's first information innovation enterprise currently deployed in Guangxi, mainly producing and selling general and domestic terminal PCs, notebooks, servers and other IT equipment. In the production workshop, workers are busy inspecting and debugging production equipment. "The first computer of Tongfang Computer Yulin Base officially rolled off the production line on September 30, 2020, and our output reached more than 20,000 sets within two months." Lin Chao, deputy general manager of Guangxi Tongde Future Computer Co., Ltd., introduced that Tongfang Computer Yulin Base was jointly established by Tongfang Computer Co., Ltd. and Guangxi Tongde Future Computer Co., Ltd. to build a production base of microcomputers and rack servers based on domestic Loongson and Megachip CPUs, with a total investment of 1.05 billion yuan and three phases of construction. "With the full support of the Yulin Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government, the project took only 26 days from signing the contract to putting into production, and we are currently using the time to transport materials to debug the equipment to prepare sufficient power for the next accelerated production speed, and strive to take the first step in the first year of the '14th Five-Year Plan' to help the high-quality development of the electronic information industry in Yulin." Forestry Chao said.</p>
                        <p>Tongfang Computer Yulin Base is a microcosm of the accelerated construction of Guangxi Advanced Equipment Manufacturing City (Yulin). It is understood that in 2020, Guangxi Advanced Equipment Manufacturing City (Yulin) continued to increase the construction of infrastructure and related supporting facilities, completed infrastructure investment of 276 million yuan from January to December 2020, a year-on-year increase of 14.69%, and in 2020, the construction of standard workshops of 600,000 square meters has begun, and 10 roads in infrastructure road projects have been basically completed; A sewage treatment plant that treats 5,000 tons of sewage per day has been built; The comprehensive supporting service center is expected to be partially delivered in March 2021, and after all delivery, it can provide 6,000 staff accommodation beds, and at the same time complete construction facilities such as large supermarkets, staff canteens, office buildings and expert buildings.</p>

                            At the beginning of the new year of 2020, the relevant departments and construction enterprises of Beiliu City worked together to step up the construction of infrastructure such as standard factory buildings and park roads, and strive to build a good development platform for enterprises stationed in the park, laying a solid foundation for Beiliu City to achieve a good start of the "14th Five-Year Plan" and maintain high-quality economic and social development.

                        <p>
                            To build a pilot pilot zone for the integrated development of the "two bays" industry, Beiliu City will take the lead and take the lead. Since 2020, Beiliu City has made every effort to promote the planning and construction of Guangxi (Beiliu) Light Industry Industrial Park, according to the development model of "one park, multiple districts, overall promotion", and focusing on the development of five leading industries such as light industrial materials, fine chemicals, electronic information, modern logistics, energy conservation and environmental protection. "According to the plan, the construction of 1 million square meters of standardized factory buildings will be completed in the first half of this year, which will build a better platform for the introduction of the project." Wen Houyao, deputy director of the management committee of Beiliu Industrial Park, said.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While making every effort to build the park, Beiliu City adheres to the normalization of "big investment, big business" concentrated work and signed a large number of projects. With a large number of enterprises settled and put into operation, this benchmark industrial park for the integrated development of the "two bays" industry will shine, further promoting the high-quality agglomeration and development of the garment and leather industry in Beiliu City and even Yulin City.
