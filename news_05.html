                          "Suitable mountain is not suitable, all uneasy, all colors change".This is a word widely circulated in Guangxi at the end of the Anti-Japanese War.In the winter of 1944, the Japanese invaded Guangxi for the second time, Nanning, Wuzhou, Guilin, Liuzhou...They fell one after another in the cold wind.Guangxi was divided into several parts, and the southeastern part of Guangxi became an isolated island hanging behind enemy lines.
                      </p>
                        <p>At this critical juncture of life and death, Party organizations all over Guangxi resolutely carried out the "August Decision" made by the Guangxi Working Committee of the Communist Party of China, organized the establishment of base areas behind enemy lines, and carried out armed struggle behind enemy lines.Headed by Wu Jiayi, Zhang Xihe, Qin Huli, Li Yunhao, Tan Liuke, Tan Zhensheng and so on, the anti-Japanese guerrilla office in southeast Guangxi was born.</p>
                        <p>"This' Yun Sang building 'was originally the home of democratic progressive Tan Zhensheng, but also a secret revolutionary point at that time.Later generations in order to carry forward Tan Zhensheng revolutionary spirit, the building named Zhensheng building."In Longtan Village Party branch secretary, village committee director Qin Ju under the leadership, we stepped into the southeast of the anti-Japanese armed uprising command site of the seismic sound building.</p>

                            Tan Zhensheng is a famous talent in Xingye, good at poetry, literature and art theory, and has made considerable achievements in calligraphy. He studied from Kang Youwei and further studied calligraphy. He has successively served as secretary of the Second Army of the Guangdong Army, commissioner of the General Bureau of Chaomei's Rating in Guangdong, head of Tian 'e County of Guangxi, Chief of the Military law of the Seventh Army of Guangxi Li Mingrui, commissioner of the Department of Finance of Guangxi and many other posts, and is quite famous in the local area.

                        <p>
                            In the spring of 1939, Qin Zhuli, in accordance with the anti-Japanese national united front policy, joined forces with Qin Zhensheng, then deputy speaker of Xingye County Council, to set up the Guangdong and Guangxi Border Area Anti-Enemy Support Association office.Qin Zhuli was appointed director.
                        </p>
                        <p>In the early morning of March 2, 1945 (the 18th of the first lunar month), in order to save the masses of people from fire and water, the anti-Japanese armed uprising in southeast Guangxi fired the first shot in Xingye County.</p>
                        <p>Tan Zhensheng, aged at that time, publicly announced the anti-Japanese, firmly stand together with the uprising team, and selflessly gave all the family wealth, let the rebel army headquarters in their own.</p>
                        <p>
                           An armed uprising to defend the home and the country began with vigour and vitality.A total of 2,800 anti-Japanese self-defense troops in Xingye, Luchuan, Bobai and Rong counties staged an uprising, and more than 10,000 people armed with broadswords and spears joined the battle, which lasted for more than 20 days.Afraid of the anti-Japanese self-defense forces are victorious in successive battles, high morale, the Kuomintang government unwilling to fail, request Yulin five Yulin several times of the forces on the rebel army crazy suppression.
                        </p>
                        <p>Outnumbered and inexperienced in armed struggle, the insurrectionary troops were fiercely attacked by the obstinacy.In order to preserve the anti-Japanese force, the headquarters decided to pull the team back to sixty thousand mountain guerrilla warfare, break up the whole, waiting for an opportunity to counter.</p>
                        <p>"The war that year was extremely fierce. The enemy took revenge on many villages that participated in the uprising, such as Zade and Pung Shan, by burning and slaughtering them.The fire burned for three days and nights in a terrible blaze.As the headquarters of the uprising, the Acoustic building was also targeted for retaliation. It was thanks to Li Zhongdan, then president of the Xingye County Senate, who resisted the pressure to preserve the Acoustic building, that this building with glorious historical and cultural value was finally preserved."Lu Zicheng said.</p>

                            In early summer, the land of Yulin is green and full of vitality.We drove into the old revolutionary village -- Quanjiang Village, Kuiyang Town, Xingye County.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The pines and cypresses are shaded by the trees.On foot, we came to the Martyrs' Memorial square of Pengmaogui. We stood solemnly and silently, remembering the revolutionary martyrs, and listened carefully to the unforgettable red years.
                        </p>
                        <p>According to Peng Guangmian, Peng Maokui was born in 1905. His father died at the age of 3, and his mother died at the age of 9.The life story of Maokui Peng is clearly recorded on the inscription of Martyr Memorial Square: Maokui Peng, also known as Peng Deming, is a native of Quanjiang Village, Tielian Township, our city.He graduated from Xingye County High School in 1929 and was then admitted to Shanghai China Public School and later joined the Communist Party of China.He was arrested in September 1930 and released from prison after being rescued by the Party organization and the headmaster of China Public School Shao Lizi.In 1932, he returned to Guangxi and participated in the reconstruction of Yongning County Committee of the CPC.In 1936, he attended the Party Congress of Guangxi Province and was elected to the Standing Committee of the Provincial Working Committee and the Minister of Publicity. He was also the Secretary of the Preparatory Committee and the Municipal Committee of Nanning. After 1937, he became the secretary of the Guangxi Working Committee of the CPC.He was arrested in Nanning in April 1938 and released from prison by Zhou Enlai and the Guilin Office of the Eighth Route Army at the end of the year. Later, he became a member of the Wuzhou Special Branch.In 1940, he returned to Xingye County for secret activities.In the spring of 1945, he took part in the anti-Japanese armed uprising in southeast Guangxi and became the captain of Tiecheng Detachment of the Xingye People's anti-Japanese Self-Defense Army.In March of the same year, he went to Shuangfeng Township, Bobai County, and was rounded up by the Kuomintang army.</p>
                        <p>Heaven and earth heroic gas, Qianqiu still awe inspiring."The most touching thing is that Ferao Peng was arrested three times in his life, but he was always unyielding;He lost contact with the Party organization twice after joining the Party, but his revolutionary belief remained unchanged;He served as secretary of the Guangxi Working Committee of the Communist Party of China, secretary of the Nanning Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and later became a grassroots cadre, but no matter what position he held, he remained loyal to the Party and persisted in the revolutionary struggle until he finally laid down his precious life."Peng Jianmian was a high school teacher in Xingye County before retirement. After retirement, he consulted a large number of historical data and collected and sorted out the data of Peng Maokui martyrs. "For me, the whole process of collecting and sorting out the martyrs' data is a spiritual baptism process of asking for the original aspiratnand quenching the Party spirit."</p>
                        <p>"No matter what position he holds, Peng remains loyal to the Party.This spirit is touching and motivates me to do well in my job."Peng Guangmian said that the spirit of martyrs constantly inspires the whole village to forge ahead and work hard, writing the remarkable journey of Quanjiang Village from a poor and backward old revolutionary village to a prosperous and prosperous new village.</p>
                        <p>On the Maokui Peng Memorial Square, apart from Maokui Peng, we also see the names of seven martyrs.In 1945, southeast Guangxi anti-Japanese armed uprising, the Tiecheng detachment with the people of Quanjiang Village, Kuiyang Town, Xingye County as the main body and Peng Maogui as the leader fought hard in this revolutionary armed uprising.Peng Maogui led the Tiecheng detachment to conquer the Tiecheng Township office, and then successfully ambushed the Kuomintang reactionary army to smuggle munitions in the Tiecheng in the Yangding Ao, and won the first major victory in the southeast of Guangxi uprising.Then, the Tiecheng detachment took part in the battle of Quanjiang Village, attack Xingye County and other series of battles.</p>
                        <p>Following the anti-Japanese armed uprising in southeast Guangxi, Quanjiang Village revolutionaries have participated in the liberation campaign of Xingye County and made significant contributions to the great revolutionary cause.Now, the third floor of the village committee building of Quanjiang Village has been opened into a revolutionary exhibition hall. The green sand table, yellow documents and rusty rifles silently tell the heroic deeds of Quanjiang people who rushed to revolution one after another.</p>
                        <p>Since this year, Quanjiang Village has steadily promoted the study and education of the Party history, taking "I do practical things for the masses" practice activities as the foothold of the study and education of the Party history, so as to make the study and education of the Party history "alive"."At present, we are grasping the renovation and renovation of the Martyrs' Memorial Workshop of Payogui, which is expected to be completed before July 1st this year. While presenting a congratulatory gift for the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Party, it can also better promote the spirit of the old revolutionary base area, drive red tourism and increase the collective economic income of the village."Peng Guangmian told reporters.</p>
                        <p>Revolutionary cultural relics bear the glorious history of the heroic struggles of the Party and the people, and record the great journey and touching deeds of the Chinese revolution.In 1985, Yulin City at the county level designated the former residence of the martyr Maokui Peng as the "Old Site of the Iron City Detachment of the Southeast Guangxi Uprising" cultural relic protection unit.</p>
                        <p>In order to better protect the revolutionary cultural relics, Quanjiang Village asked special personnel to draft a restoration plan for the former residence of Maokui Peng."Our generation should work hard to protect and make good use of revolutionary cultural relics, so that the spirit of heroes will continue to shine through time and space."Peng Guangmian said.</p>
